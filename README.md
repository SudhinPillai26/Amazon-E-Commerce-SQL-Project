![Project Banner Placeholder](https://www.catwalkyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Amazon.com-Logo.svg_1.png)

Welcome to my SQL project, where I analyze real-time data from **Amazon.com**! This project uses a dataset of **20,000+ sales records** and additional tables for payments, products, and shipping data to explore and analyze e-commerce transactions, product sales, and customer interactions. The project aims to solve business problems through SQL queries, helping Amazon make informed decisions.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates essential SQL skills by analyzing e-commerce data from **Amazon**, focusing on sales, payments, products, and customer data. Through SQL, we answer critical business questions, uncover trends, and derive actionable insights that help improve business strategies and customer experiences. The project covers different SQL techniques including **Joins**, **Group By**, **Aggregations**, and **Date Functions**.

## Project Structure

1. **SQL Scripts**: Contains code to create the database schema and write queries for analysis.
2. **Dataset**: Real-time data representing e-commerce transactions, product details, customer information, and shipping status.
3. **Analysis**: SQL queries crafted to solve business problems, each focusing on understanding e-commerce sales and performance.

## Database Schema

Hereâ€™s an overview of the database structure:

### 1. **Customers Table**
- **customer_id**: Unique identifier for each customer

- **product_name**: Name of the product
- **price**: Price of the product
- **cogs**: Cost of goods sold
- **category**: Category of the product
- **brand**: Brand name of the product

### 3. **Sales Table**
- **order_id**: Unique order identifier
- **order_date**: Date the order was placed
- **customer_id**: Linked to the `customers` table
- **order_status**: Status of the order (e.g., Completed, Cancelled)
- **product_id**: Linked to the `products` table
- **quantity**: Quantity of products sold
- **price_per_unit**: Price per unit of the product

### 4. **Payments Table**
- **payment_id**: Unique payment identifier
- **order_id**: Linked to the `sales` table
- **payment_date**: Date the payment was made
